### Creating a Repo
  - Used to organize a single project
  - Can contain:
    * Folders
    * Files
    * Images
    * Videos
    * Spreadsheets
    * Etc....

Repos often contain a `README` (using Markdown)

### Creating a Branch
Branching allows you to have different versions of a repo at the same time. 
The default branch is named: `MAIN`. Additional branches will stem off of `MAIN`, and you can work different branches of a project without changing the source. **For example:** If you have two different features/items/etc... that need to be worked on separately, you can create two different branches to be merged later.

Branches can be used to experiment and make edits before committing them to `MAIN`.

#### Final note on creating branches:
If updates are made to `MAIN` while working on a branch, those changes can be updated into the active/working branches.
