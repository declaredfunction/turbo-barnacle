# turbo-barnacle
## Initial GitHub Repo - Hello World Projects

### Naming Conventions

Turbo-barnacle = Initial Repo (Main branch)

Initial-Edit = First branch off main
  * if sub-branch is required, begin naming conventions alphabetically with fruit. 
  #### EXAMPLE:
  > Initial-Edit-Apricot
 
 In the following example, the inital branch `banana`, has a branch of it's own `blueberry`. This is used to test if `C` can be added to `B` successfully, before merging both into `A` (the main branch).
  > Initial-Edit-Banana
  > > Initial-Edit-Blueberry

### Creating a Repo
  - Used to organize a single project
  - Can contain:
    * Folders
    * Files
    * Images
    * Videos
    * Spreadsheets
    * Etc....

Repos often contain a `README` (using Markdown)

### Creating a Branch
Branching allows you to have different versions of a repo at the same time. 
The default branch is named: `MAIN`. Additional branches will stem off of `MAIN`, and you can work different branches of a project without changing the source. **For example:** If you have two different features/items/etc... that need to be worked on separately, you can create two different branches to be merged later.

Branches can be used to experiment and make edits before committing them to `MAIN`.

#### Final note on creating branches:
If updates are made to `MAIN` while working on a branch, those changes can be updated into the active/working branches.
